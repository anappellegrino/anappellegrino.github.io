# What is VIP?

The Violence, Instability, and Peace (VIP) Workshop is a virtual forum for scholars studying conflict, crime, peace, and related topics to receive feedback on research-in-progress, including working papers and well-developed pre-analysis plans. The workshop is open to scholars from political science and related disciplines (e.g., political sociology, economics), and from across subfields. 

We are open to work from scholars at all career stages, although we particularly aim to provide opportunities for junior scholars and early career researchers, including pre-tenure and non-tenure track faculty, post-docs, and graduate students. We are also committed to promoting opportunities for scholars from historically excluded communities.

## Format

Our group holds a one-hour-long workshop-style forum on the second Thursday of each month. To accommodate scholars from across the globe, we alternate between two pre-determined times: 
- 8am PST/11am EST/4pm GMT; and 
- 12pm PST/ 3pm EST/8pm GMT.

Sessions will be dedicated to providing feedback on two featured papers; accordingly, authors will only provide a short 5-minute presentation to provide an overview of the paper. Each paper will then receive 25 minutes of dedicated feedback from both a chosen discussant and other participants. Manuscripts will be circulated at least one week in advance, and all participants are expected to read them.

We will consider submissions of full papers (e.g., to be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal, a chapter in an edited volume, or a job market paper) and well-developed research designs or pre-analysis plans. If accepted, you will provide a short presentation (about 5 minutes) and receive about 25 minutes of feedback from a discussant and attendants.

Scholars at varying stages of their careers (from advanced PhD candidates to tenured scholars) can serve as discussants, as long as they are willing to read research-in-progress and provide about 10 minutes of feedback. We will do our best to match you with a paper that fits your area of expertise.
