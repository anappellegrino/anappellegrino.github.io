# What is VIP?

The Violence, Instability, and Peace (VIP) Workshop is a virtual forum for scholars studying conflict, protest, crime, peace, and related topics to receive feedback on research-in-progress, including working papers and well-developed pre-analysis plans. The workshop is open to scholars from political science and related disciplines (e.g., sociology, economics, psychology, communication), and from across subfields.

# Sign up!

- Do you want to **present** your work? Come back in late fall, when we'll open submissions for Spring 2023!

We will consider submissions of full papers (e.g., to be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal, a chapter in an edited volume, or a job market paper) and well-developed research designs or pre-analysis plans. If accepted, you will provide a short presentation (about 5 minutes) and receive about 25 minutes of feedback from a discussant and attendants.

We are open to work from scholars at all career stages, although we particularly aim to provide opportunities for junior scholars and early career researchers, including pre-tenure and non-tenure track faculty, post-docs, and graduate students. We are also committed to promoting opportunities for scholars from historically excluded communities.


- Do you want to **discuss** your peers' work? Volunteer as a discussant [here](https://forms.gle/BVLyRLWQuZ6XSkER7). 

Scholars at varying stages of their careers (from advanced PhD candidates to tenured scholars) can serve as discussants, as long as they are willing to read research-in-progress and provide about 10 minutes of feedback. We will do our best to match you with a paper that fits your area of expertise.


- Do you just want to **stay informed** and join us in listening to the great work of your colleagues? Sign up for our list serve [here](https://forms.gle/XyMUkb5W9faWTHh97).


# Format

Our group holds a one-hour-long workshop-style forum on the second Thursday of each month. To accommodate scholars from across the globe, we alternate between two pre-determined times: 
- 8am PST/11am EST/4pm GMT; and 
- 12pm PST/ 3pm EST/8pm GMT.

Sessions will be dedicated to providing feedback on two featured papers; accordingly, authors will only provide a short 5-minute presentation to provide an overview of the paper. Each paper will then receive 25 minutes of dedicated feedback from both a chosen discussant and other participants. Manuscripts will be circulated at least one week in advance, and all participants are expected to read them.
