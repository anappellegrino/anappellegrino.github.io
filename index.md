## Research

### Dissertation Project: The Warrior's Paradox: The Rise of Parapolice Groups in Brazil  (*in progress*)

This book-length dissertation project explores armed criminal group formation and interaction with police in Brazil. I conduct a cross-case comparison between Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo from the 1980s to 2000s, tracing the emergence of armed criminal groups and police instutional development. I have conducted over 2 years of fieldwork, during which I conducted dozens of interviews and collected thousands of administrative records.

### Research in Progress

#### Killings of police officers / Mortes de policiais

What happens when a police officer is killed? In this project, I analyze how police officers deaths in Rio de Janeiro impact police lethal violence in the following days. I find that police become more deadly, albeit not more active. Such effect is shaped by police officer schedules and local rememberance practices.
